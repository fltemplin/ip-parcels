This marked-up version of bprecvfile.c is relative to ion-3.6.1. It
allows setting of a "base" testfile number so that multiple instances
of bprecvfile can be run without mutual interference of the file
creations. So, for example, it can be run as:

  bprecvfile ipn:25.1 0 100
  bprecvfile ipn:25.2 0 200
  bprecvfile ipn:25.3 0 300
  bprecvfile ipn:25.4 0 400

In this example, four instances of bprecvfile are run. The first arguement
is the local endpoint ID, the second is the number of files to receive
(0 means infinity) and the third arguement is the base number for the
creation of testfiles. So, for example, if each bprecvfile instance
received a single file, the testfiles would show up as:

  testfile101
  testfile201
  testfile301
  testfile401

On the sending side, just use bpsendfile as normal while specifying the
EID of a listening bprecvfile.

To build, set up an ion-3.6.1 source tree hierarchy and type:

  # mv ion-3.6.1/bp/utils/bprecvfile.c ion-3.6.1/bp/utils/bprecvfile.c.orig

then, copy this modified version in place of the original:

  # cp bprecvfile.c ion-3.6.1/bp/utils

Then, go to the top-level directory (ion-3.6.1) and type:

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install
  # ldconfig

Note that, even though you only need to modify bprecvfile itself you
need to do a formal "make install" (i.e., and not just manually copy the
executable to the /usr/local/bin directory). Copying the file w/o a make
install leaves you with a non-functioanl executable.
